Let us use the DETR network we used in the lab
Annotate ~120-150 images
Look for large objects, e.g. the file like 2021-06-13_19-22-13-front.mp4
Create at least two classes. Recommended: 'Car' and 'SUV'
Feel free to use MakeSense AI or Roboflow.Make sure your annotations are (or converted to) the coco format.
Recommended: use Active Learning
Train for as many epochs as needed to cross the 0.4 IoU=0.50:0.95
